While Clorox and UiPath began their journeys from different starting points—one focused on creating a governance-driven blueprint for expansion, the other on executing high-impact use cases—both have applied the same core principles: thoughtful use case selection, strong governance, measurable outcomes, and a vision for enterprise-wide adoption. Together, they will share how these principles translate into scalable, well-governed agentic automation programs that drive real business value, offering practical guidance attendees can put into action.",
